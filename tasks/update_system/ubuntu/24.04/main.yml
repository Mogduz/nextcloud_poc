# File: main.yml
# Summary: Delegates execution to the OS-unified task list for system updates
#          to keep logic centralized and DRY.
# Flow overview:
#   • Dispatch to 'update_system/ubuntu/all/main.yml' via include_tasks.
#   • The included file performs the real update/upgrade workflow.
# Rationale:
#   • Centralize logic for all Ubuntu versions to reduce duplication.
#   • Make per-OS entrypoints thin and easy to maintain.

# Task: Include OS-generic Ubuntu update workflow
# Preconditions: 'tasks_dir' is defined; target include file exists and is readable.
# Effects: Control transfers into the included task file; no changes by this stub.
# Idempotency: The include itself is idempotent; idempotency is enforced within
#              the included tasks.
# Error handling: Will fail if the referenced file path is wrong or missing.
# Security: This stub does not escalate privileges; included tasks may use 'become'.
# Performance: Negligible overhead; include avoids duplicate logic across versions.
